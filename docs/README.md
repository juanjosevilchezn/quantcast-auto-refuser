# Cookie Monster Dialog

Cookie Monster Dialog is a browser extension that hides cookie consent dialogs without changing user preferences. By default, we do NOT accept cookies (except in [a few cases](https://github.com/wanhose/cookie-dialog-monster/blob/main/database.json#L248) where the pages do not function without accepting them). You can report broken sites with a single click, which will create an issue in this repository to be fixed promptly.
